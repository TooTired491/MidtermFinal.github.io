      <p class="Enviroment">Nature is a reoccurring theme amongst his films. Miyazaki believes the destruction of nature and the destruction of the human soul are the same even though in most of his films, it is man versus nature. For example, In Princess Mononoke, San, who was raised by wolves and spirits, are angry at men for their actions of destroying the forest for profit and their own gain.<br><br> Another was in Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind where a toxin plagues their lands and rather than treating the Omn as creatures who were living amongst the polluted world as the humans were doing the same but had to wear masks when travelling. Another thing in that movie was it was proven that the only reason that there is a toxic jungle is due to the polluted soil itself. This idea of nature bouncing back from human caused pollution is what interested him. Shintoism is an ancient Japanese religion that centers around worshipping the Kami, divine spirits or deities, nature, and ancestors. Overall to emphasize the harmony and respect for the natural world where both humans and nature live in the same world. This is practiced throughout his films which make them feel so capturing for the viewer. </p>

            <p class="Antiwar">Miyazaki is Anti-war. He was born in Tokyo during the midst of WWII and his father’s company manufactured fighter plane parts which he resented so he became a pacifist as he got older. In Porco Rosso and Howl’s Moving Castle, you hear or see parts that speak of a war going on in the background yet that is not the main point of the film. The same guilt that Porco feels about not doing more to save his friends and he survived is like the same guilt that Miyazaki feels about Japan’s involvement in WWII, considering his family financial safety was from war. <br><br>In 2003 when Spirited Away won an Oscar for Best Animated feature. He refused to attend because as he told LA Times that he didn’t want to visit a country that was bombing Iraq. In Howl’s moving Castle, the parts of war that were seen were the actions of governmental decisions that affected the civilians who had little to do with the whole war together. Howl’s bitterness is like Miyazaki’s towards war where the bitterness can turn them into monsters. </p>

         <p class="Aviation">Miyazaki has always been fascinated by planes and flying that a flying sequence is always implemented into his movies. In his movie The Wind Rises, Miyazaki focused on a creator’s journey to make a plane as it was based off a real aviator engineer and was one of his favorite movies. However, he received backlash from both sides by evading the atrocities caused by Japan and ignoring those global consequences. He was criticized of being anti-Japanese propaganda and not critical enough. From then on, he did not want to draw planes as a symbol of power, but as a beautiful creation of man.

            <p class="Feminism">At the time all the industry had to offer was romance and crushes to young girls, he decide to give them a change where they could be the heroine that show both strong and moments with flaws and driving the story with their choices. He made these heroines more realistic. His mother’s influence was another strong influence when it came to creating female characters from young to old. He also portrays romance as a part of life rather than both automatically being in a relationship, but a relationship where both mutually inspire each other to live. </p>

          <section class="Belief5">
<p class="Presence">The mundane can have an impact, heavier than expected. Miyazaki feels children understand the best as of living in the present and such small moments can be wonderous and gratitude. Such mundane things are factors of slice of life category, especially feeling a warm towel, taking a trip to the market, or even food as it can bring a sense of ease. These small moments that bring comfort in times of chaos and burnout which Studio Ghibli is known for. Those small moments that became memoires that some people look back on and find comfort in them.</p>
