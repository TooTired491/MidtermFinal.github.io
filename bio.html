   <p> Miyazki was born in Japan on January 5th, 1941 and the second child of four sons. He did not have a good relationship with his father as his father continued going to night clubs after turning 70. His early memories are of bombed out cities as at the age of three, the family had to evacuate to Utsunomiya. They had to evacuate again due to the bombing at Utsunomiya in July 1945. These memories left a lasting impression on him. Miyazki had health issues and was told that he would not live past 20, making him feel weak. His mother also suffered from spinal tuberculosis. <br><br>After spending a few years in the hospital, she was forced to be nursed at home which caused her children to take over the household chores. He was close with her and her influence was strong, not only on himself, but his work</p>

                <p class="Career">During the later part of his primary school years, he aspired to become a manga artist and found out that he could not draw people,but he drew tanks, planes, and battleships for a few years. He ended up destroying his work because he saw them as bad from to copy the art style of one of the artists he looked up to, and impeding as he had yet to develop his skills as an artist. In High School, he became interested in animation from a movie called Panda and the Magic Serpent. He fell in love with the heroine and the film moved him. <br><br>For college, he attended Gakushuin University to major in Japanese Industrial Theory yet he spent more time drawing and pursuing more opportunities to draw stories. He graduated Gakushin in 1963 with degrees in both political science and economics.

<!--Begining of career-->
    <section class=FigureCl>
            <p class=Figure>Early in his career, he worked at Toei Animation in 1963 as an in-between scene artist and key animator in several films. There was a time that he considered leaving the industry due to him eventually finding inbetween art as unsatisfactory and craved to work on more artistic vivid projects. However after catching a screening of an animated movie called The Snow Queen in 1964, he went back to work with determination and energy. From there on, he went from inbetween artist to key animation, concept artist, and scene designer for several projects. He faced highs and lows while working at Toei animations before leaving in 1971, mainly due to becoming unsatisfied with the lack of creative state and freedom. He moved to work on bigger creative projects.

                <p class= "Nausicaa">Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind which he wrote and illustrated manga for from February 1982 - March 1994. Yet after the first two volumes, the magazine Animage, which focuses on animations and comics, editors reached out to Miyazaki about the possibility of a 15 minute short film, but Miyazaki countered with it to be an hour long which was agreed to. Production began on May 31, 1983, and animation came later in August 1983. An animation Studio called Topcraft was chosen for the project which Miyazaki found unreliable, so he pulled together his own team, consisting of past collaborators. <br><br>He found it difficult to make a screenplay with only sixteen chapters. One of the collaborators, Isao Takahata, previously worked at Toei animations around the same time as Miyazaki, suggested the help of Joe Hisaishi, an experimental and minimalist musician, to make the film’s score which landed him working him on all of Miyazaki’s later feature films. Released on March 11,1984, the movie was a hit and is usually seen as what cemented his reputation as an animator.</p> </div>

<!--Studio Ghibli-->
          <section class="slide5">
<p class=Studio>After Nausicaa, he co-found Studio Ghibli in 1985 with Takahata, Toshio Suzuki, and Yasuyoshi Tokuma. The studio was nicknamed after an Italian plane due to Miyazaki’s passion for aircrafts as well as the idea that the studio would “blow a new wind through the anime industry”. Staff members were hired at Studio Ghibli, 70 full times and up to 200 part timers, had worked with Miyazaki at several studios. From that point, Miyazaki poured his life into each film, the mark Studio Ghibli left on people worldwide and giving it the recognition it gets to this day.</p>

  <p class= "life">Miyazaki’s wife is Akemi Ōta, born in 1938, and was hired as an in-between artists at Toei Animation in 1958. She worked on Panda and the Magic Serpent and Alakazam the Great. Miyazaki met her at Toei animation in 1964 and married in October 1965. They worked on several projects together. In January 1967, their first son, Goro, was born and their second son, Keisuke, was born in April 1969. The shift into fatherhood changed Miyazaki as he tried to produce work to appeal to his children.  Originally, Miyazaki promised his wife that they would both go bac to work after Goro was born and would drop him off at daycare. <br><br>Yet, seeing how exhausted Goro was after walking home one day, it changed Miyazaki’s mind, and his wife quitted in 1972 to stay home and raise the children, even though she was reluctant to but did so her husband could focus on his work. Due to the dedication to his work and being often absent, Miyazaki's relationships with his sons were harmed. Miyazaki confessed that he tried to be a good father, but he was not in the end. Goro, directed Tales of Earthsea, mentioned that his father would get zero points on being a father, but full marks as a director.</p>
