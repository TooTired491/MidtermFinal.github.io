    <div class= "History"><h3>Biography</h3>
    <div class= "Info"> <p>Miyazki was born in Japan on January 5th, 1941 and the second child of four sons. He did not have a good relationship with his father as his father continued going to night clubs after turning 70. 

His early memories are of bombed out cities as at the age of three, the family had to evacuate to Utsunomiya. They had to evacuate again due to the bombing at Utsunomiya in July 1945. These memories left a lasting impression on him.

Miyazki had health issues and was told that he would not live past 20, making him feel weak. His mother also suffered from spinal tuberculosis. After spending a few years in the hospital, she was forced to be nursed at home which caused her children to take over the household chores. He was close with her and her influence was strong, not only on himself, but his work.
